# SQL Data Analysis README

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries for performing data analysis on various datasets using SQL. The analysis aims to provide insights into different aspects of the data such as trends, patterns, and relationships.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have access to a SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
3. Import your dataset into the database or create tables and populate them with your own data.

## Data Exploration
### 1. Data Inspection
- Use the `DESCRIBE` command to view the structure of your dataset:
    ```sql
    DESCRIBE your_table_name;
    ```

- View sample records from your dataset:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM your_table_name LIMIT 10;
    ```

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Perform necessary data cleaning tasks such as:
    - Converting data types
    - Handling missing values
    - Removing duplicates
    - Standardizing data formats

### 3. Data Exploration
- Explore various aspects of your data using SQL queries such as:
    - Counting total records and distinct values of columns
    - Calculating averages, sums, and other aggregate functions
    - Grouping data by categories and calculating statistics
    - Identifying patterns and trends
    - Finding correlations between different variables

## Usage
Run the provided SQL queries against your dataset to perform the desired analysis.

## Dependencies
- SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Dataset to analyze
